# ❓ is python weakly typed? or is it strongly typed?

# 📍 bool() function
# - see bool-function.md
# - true and false are special constants of type bool
# - can be used for checking if a list is empty or not
# - Python automatically uses bool() behind the scenes in conditions

# 📍 typecasting
# - see typecasting.md
# ☑️ example (can't add a string and a number directly)
# age = 25
# msg = "I am " + age + " years old"
# - doing this gives : TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
